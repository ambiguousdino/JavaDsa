## Welcome!
JavaDsa is a project built for practice and learning, focusing on implementing data structures and algorithms in Java.

## What's Inside?
Here’s what you’ll find so far:
- **Data Structures:**
  - **Lists:** `LinkedList` and `ArrayList` (with `Stack` and `Queue` coming soon!).
  - **Trees:** `BinarySearchTree`, `MinHeap`, and `MaxHeap`.
  - **In Progress:** Graph data structures.
- **Algorithms:** Sorting, path-finding, and more are planned for the future.

### Project Structure
- **API (`api`):** Interfaces that define the behavior of each data structure.
- **Implementation (`implementation`):** The actual code for each data structure.
- **Application (`app`):** Includes `DsaApp`, a simple runner for creating and testing instances of the structures.
  
Even though this project isn't managed with Maven or Gradle, the package structure is ready for use with either tool if you prefer.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository and check out the `src/main/java` directory.
2. To learn and practice, dive into the `implementation` package and try modifying or completing the methods.
3. Use the `DsaApp` in the `app` package to create instances and test the functionality of your structures.
4. Running on Windows? Use the provided PowerShell script `runproject.ps1` to compile and execute your work.
